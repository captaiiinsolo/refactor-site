# Horiseon Site Refactor


## Description

For this project, I refactored the client's code with semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure. Alt attributes have been added to image elements for greater accessibility. Additionally, I organized the CSS elements to match the flow of the HTML and added comments to make it easier to navigate.  

Examples can be seen below:
